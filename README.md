![example application](https://github.com/shiMusa/Simple-Conrod/blob/master/example_new.PNG)

The main goal is
 - a simple interface for users, especially for beginners and intermediates
 - not necessary performance, but ease of understanding
 - fast prototyping and construction
 
Main inspiration: Java framework.
 
<b>BEWARE:</b> I'm new to Rust, I'm not a professional programmer, I make mistakes - a lot...
 
Plans:
 - many more Elements
 - gui animations
 - scientific plotting
 - implementing other backends (Gfx, glutin)
 
Example can be found in main() function.
